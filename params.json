{"name":"Torchlit","google":"","tagline":"torchlight 2 aid","body":"\r\n\r\n![screenshot](http://i739.photobucket.com/albums/xx38/dodo_dodder/torchlitscreen.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\n\r\nThis script is written to aid torchlight 2. It converts mouse scrolls and middle clicks to keystrokes to aid in battle. :)\r\n\r\n\r\nREQUIREMENTS: 64 bit windows\r\n\r\nUsage:\r\n\r\n1.download the dist.7z archive. \r\n\r\n2.run torchlitgui.exe\r\n\r\n3.enter what keys you want to replace mouse scroll up , mouse scroll down and middle click with. currently mouse scroll up and down only accepts one keystroke as a replacement. middle mouse click can be changed to a string of keystrokes. the syntax for which can be found at http://www.rutherfurd.net/python/sendkeys/\r\n\r\n4.set up key bindings in torchlight 2 for cycle weapons as the keys you set up mouse scroll in torchlit.Unbind mouse scroll from other functions. the middle click is designed to call 3 skills automatically. eg as a berserker i have 8,9,0 as middle click replacement and have kept 3 self cast/summoning skills in the skill bar. SO i just click the middle mouse button and it casts all the pre battle skills i need to cast before entering a crowd of enemies.\r\n\r\n5.click start to enable the conversion and stop to disable.\r\n\r\n\r\nTIP: experiment the pause time between the last 2 buttons in the middle mouse replacement as for different skills different times might be needed. This has something to do with torchlight cast times themselves.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nENJOY.
